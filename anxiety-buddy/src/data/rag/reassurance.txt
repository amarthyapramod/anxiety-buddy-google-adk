Calming Truths for Anxiety

When Feeling Panic:
- "This is temporary. Panic attacks peak within 10 minutes."
- "I am not dying. This is anxiety, not danger."
- "My body is protecting me, though there's no real threat."
- "I've survived 100% of my panic attacks."

When Overwhelmed:
- "I only need to focus on this moment."
- "I can do hard things. I've done them before."
- "It's okay to not be okay right now."
- "My feelings are valid."

Cognitive Reframing:
Instead of: "I can't handle this"
Try: "This is hard, but I'm handling it right now"

Instead of: "What if everything goes wrong?"
Try: "What if things go okay?"

The 90-Second Rule:
Strong emotions trigger chemicals that flush out within 90 seconds. If you're still feeling it after that, you're re-triggering it with your thoughts.
