Box Breathing Exercise (4-4-4-4)

This technique is used by Navy SEALs to stay calm under pressure.

Steps:
1. Sit comfortably with your back straight and feet flat on the floor
2. Breathe in slowly through your nose for 4 counts
3. Hold your breath for 4 counts
4. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for 6 counts
5. Hold empty for 4 counts
6. Repeat this cycle 5-10 times

Why it works: Slow breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system, signaling your body to relax.
